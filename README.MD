# fx-rates-service

This is a dummy application that emulates FX Rates Service.

## Task

Write unit tests for the application:

- Use Java-based unit testing library, preferably JUnit 5 with AssertJ for assertions.
- Make sure that the application has an _appropriate_ unit test code coverage.
- You are allowed to modify the code to make it more testable.
- Add your code to a publicly available source control and send an email with a link to it. We
  suggest to fork this repository in GitHub and submit a PR.
